With this code I am creating an interactive registration form that will allow users to select a job role with the ability to add an "other" field. Users will be able select a color and design theme from their t-shirt option, pick which activity the would like to attend with the amount for each activity calculated for payment. Users will be able to pick a payment method and all functions will have live validations for errors.
